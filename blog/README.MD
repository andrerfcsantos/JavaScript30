# Javascript30: My Blog

[Wes Bros](https://wesbos.com/) created [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), a series of 30 little challenges intended to be made with vanilla Javascript.

The fact this uses no frameworks or extra libraries means one can focus just on learning javascript and leave the extra learning of frameworks and libraries for later. In addition, since each challenge is a web page, it's also an opportunity to learn CSS too. These were the 2 main reasons i decided to take the challenge myself.

The idea of this "blog" is to discuss my solutions a little bit and recap some lessons learned from these challenges.
